#Factorials with For Loops
#Now use a for loop to find the factorial!

#It will now be great practice for you to try to revise the code you wrote above to find the factorial of a number, but this time, using a for loop. Try it in the code editor below!

# number to find the factorial of
number = 6   

# start with our product equal to one
product = 1

for i in range(number, 0, -1):
	product = product * i




# print the factorial of number
print(product)
